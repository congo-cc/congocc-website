Placeholder for blogs for 2022.

The blog listed for 2022 came from an email from Jon that he thought would probably become a published blog post at some point.

Note that the Title line MUST be the first line inside the JBake header lines. Also note that the author field must be filled in or the file won't get "baked" and no html output will be generated. The status of Draft does NOT prevent this file from being converted into an html page but it will include the word "draft" in the name of this file. However, the status of draft does prevent it from being displayed on the website because the parsing/rendering step ignores any page/post that does *NOT* have the status of published.

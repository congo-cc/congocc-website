As promised in an earlier article, we're going to look at some of the diagramming tools which are commonly used in the field of language parsing. I like to think of these diagramming tools as alternative ways of expressing the actions and behaviors that we want our code to perform. They are different ways of depicting and viewing the steps of the program's task, much the way that watercolors and singing songs are very different ways of expressing a feeling.  

In our discussion of diagrams, we'll also touch upon what are referred to as Finite Automata which are basically recognizers. If you'd like to read more about them right now, you can skip ahead to the section with that same name.

First, let's take a look at a simple state diagram, sometimes also called a transition diagram. Following is a state diagram for skipping whitespace (WS).

State diagrams typically flow from left to right and this one is no exception: the diagram starts at the left and ends at the right. At the moment when we are at the START symbol, we don't know (or care) was the software code was doing before. We could be at the first line of the code or in the middle of a function, it doesn't matter. What matters is that at the moment that whitespace is read in (at point #1, the first diamond on the left) we stop doing whatever we were doing and move into (or transition into) the box labeled SKIP WS (point #2) and stay in that box as long as whitespace is being read. It is only when something OTHER than whitespace is read (point #3) that we move on to the END symbol.

The box labeled SKIP WS is considered a "state" and the code remains in that state until some exit condition is met. In the perspective of state diagrams, the program can only be in one state at a time. 

In this extremely simple example, the only way to exit from the SKIP WS state is to read in something OTHER than whitespace, at which point that we transition to a different state, shown by the END symbol. It doesn't matter what that OTHER value was, as long as it wasn't whitespace. 

=== State Diagrams as Transition Diagrams

This same diagram can be described as a transition diagrm. Transition Diagrams refer to the lines between START and SKIP WS and END as edges. Each edge is labeled by a symbol or set of symbols that identify how we can advance (or transition) to the next state. If we are reading in the characters of a keyword (else in this case), then each edge would be labeled (left-to-right) with the letters that make up that keyword. The next diagram illustrates this.

It is important to emphasize that in this diagram there is only one single path that can lead to the keyword else being accepted in the END state. The only way to get to State 1 is to have read in an "e" and the only way to get to State 2 is to read in an "l" as the next character. If any other character is read, then we cannot be reading the keyword else. 

This diagram shows the keyword ending with WS (Whitespace). If something other than WS was read in after State 4, the keyword "else" couldn't be accepted and the flow couldn't move to the END state. Instead, reading of characters would continue until WS was read in and the string of characters read in would be accepted as some kind of identifier.

This diagram is extremely simple because it uses terminal (literal) values to label all its edges, but tokens or productions could be used to label the edges instead. So imagine if this diagram was for User-ID, and the first "e" was replaced by the token <NAME>, the "l" was replaced by the token <DIGITS>, the "s" replaced by the token <FACILITY> and the last "e" was replaced by the token <DEPT>. Suddenly this diagram becomes more useful because it clearly and unambiguously specifies the components of the User-ID and the order that each of the components must appear.

You might wonder, if state diagrams are so terrific, why they aren't used more often. Take a look at the next diagram for reading and interpreting relative operators (<, <=, !=, etc.).

One reason is that even relatively simple reading and interpreting tasks can become large and complicated diagrams. It's not too bad reading the first character, there's four choices that can lead to states 1 - 4. But then handling the next character expands the number of choices, shown as states 5 - 12. Imagine what this diagram would have looked like if states 1 - 4 could have had more than two choices and lead to more than 20 or 30 states, with some final states shared by more than one preceding choices. 

Another reason for state diagrams not being used more is that they are *not* dynamic, so if there are changes to logic or objects, the diagrams must be manually updated to match these changes. And factor in the cost in the time and labor to create the diagrams in the first place and state diagrams just don't fit well with the lean, fast-paced development environment.

=== Other Types of Diagrams

Before we leave this blog, let's take a brief look at syntax diagrams (or railroad diagrams) as a way to represent grammars. In other words, they function similarly to state diagrams.

In this diagram, if any one of the four whitespace characters are read in, the "skip" bubble is chosen and flow returns to the left and a new character is read in. If it is one of these whitespace character, the process repeats. It is only when a non-whitespace character is read in that the "other" bubble is chosen. 

Now that I look at this diagram more closely, I suspect that I didn't draw it quite correctly. When I made this diagram, I was learning the excellent syntax diagramming tool called jSyntrax, available from github (https://github.com/atp-mipt/jsyntrax). It is based on the Syntax tool, written in Python, available from the same group, but jSyntrax is supposed to be easier to install on Windows systems and requires only Java 11.

Perhaps what I find most intriguiging about jSyntrax is how short the specifications are for the diagrams. For example, following is the spec that was used to generate the whitespace syntax diagram.

----
/* whitespace diagram  - generate with "syntrax -i whitespace2.spec -o png --title "Whitespace" */
line(
    loop(
        line(
            choice('(space char)','\\t (tab)','\\n (new line)',' \\r (carriage return)'),
            'skip')
    , None)
,('other'))
----

The github readme describes the specification as "...a hierarchy of basic elements... it is a set of nested Grooby function calls".

As much as I enjoyed learning jSyntrax, syntax diagrams suffer from the same issues that affect state diagrams: they can become complicated very quickly and they require manual maintenance to keep them up to date. But in defense of state and syntax diagrams, I am unaware of any diagramming tool that doesn't suffer from the same issues.

Next we'll look at automatons. Not Robbie the Robot kind that march around trying to warn Will Robinson about danger, but the two kinds of Finite Automata: Deterministic and Nondeterministic and how these two types of Finite Automata relate to parsers.

Placeholder for content folder that is the "top" of the blog tree.

Note that in JBake the assets folder has the img folder which, for JBake is the std images folder. It is probable that the :imagedir: <path to folder> setting can be set at the top of each blog to specify where to find the image. Perhaps for the repository it would make sense to have all images for a year to appear in a subfolder for that year. That way we wouldn't have to play games in the repository to make the images available.

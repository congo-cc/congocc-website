== Building the website

We are using a tool called https://jbake.org/[JBake] to build the static CongoCC website from static content in https://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc] format.

We suggest that you use a tool called https://sdkman.io[SDKMAN] to install JBake. To install SDKMan, it is just:

[source,bash]
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash

TIP: Sdkman is generally useful for keeping various different JDK versions installed on your system and switching between them with ease. We highly recommend it.

With Sdkman installed, you should be able to install JBake with:

[source,bash]
sdk install jbake

And then to build the CongoCC.org website:

[source,bash]
git clone https://github.com/congocc-website/congocc-website.git
cd congocc-website
jbake -b
